          These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a binding legal agreement between you and NowSpace that govern your right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings from NowSpace (collectively, the "NowSpace Platform").

              The NowSpace Platform offers an online venue that enables users ("Members") to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are "Hosts" and Members who search for, book, or use services are "Guests." Hosts offer accommodations ("Accommodations"), activities, excursions, and events ("Experiences"), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, "Host Services," and each Host Service offering, a "Listing").

                <p className="mb-4">
                  You can search for Host Services using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements, and more.

When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you and the Host. The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout apply to the Reservation.

                  As a Host, NowSpace offers you the right to use the NowSpace Platform to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our community of Guests - and earn money doing it. You can create a Listing and you are responsible for how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.

                In general, if a Guest cancels a Reservation, the amount refunded to them is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. As a Host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences.
